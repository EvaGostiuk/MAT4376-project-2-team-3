# Exploration and Visualization of the MIMIC3D Dataset

The next item we were tasked with was exploring a new dataset that contains information about ~60,000 patients. This information ranged from demographical all the way to the number of procedures the patient received when they were at the hospital. 

We first took a look at all of the data to see some initial findings and what might be of further interest, as well as researched what the given variables are. Additionally, we looked into what variables had a strong relationship with the LOSsays variable.
