# Exploration and Visualization of the MIMIC3D Dataset

The next item we were tasked with was exploring a new dataset that contains information about ~60,000 patients. This information ranged from demographical all the way to the number of procedures the patient received when they were at the hospital. 

We first took a look at all of the data to see some initial findings and what might be of further interest, as well as researched what the given variables are. *(We recommend starting here)*

Then, we looked specifically at the variables that had a strong relationship (correlation) to the variable LOSdays in order to prepare ourselves for the next task.
