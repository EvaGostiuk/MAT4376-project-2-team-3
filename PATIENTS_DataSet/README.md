# Using the Patients Dataset to Predict the Length of Stay Using Bayesian Linear Regression

Predict the length of the hospital stays for the patients in the dataset patients.csv by conducting a Bayesian
linear regression analysis. Whatâ€™s the probability of staying longer than 2 days and therefore definitely missing
work? You may want to use normal priors for simplicity

We wanted to predict the length of hospital stays for the patients in the patients.csv dataset that we created as a class. We did this by conducting Bayesian Linear Regression on the dataset and analyzing the results. *(We recommend starting here)*

Lastly, we wanted to find the probability of staying longer than two days (i.e. missing work). We did this by creating Naives Bayes Classifiers.
