# Initial Exploration and Analysis of the AB Dataset

We began by looking at the dataset to see if the hour or day of the timestamp had an effect on the number of people who were converted as well as each group individually. The **conversion rate** is the proportion of users who signed up or took other action (outside of the two pages being reported on). *(We recommend starting with the following page to see the process through our eyes)*

After that, we decided we wanted to look further into the dataset and see what would happen if we started with different initial (prior) beliefs.

From the work above, we still had some questions about the behaviour of the data, so we decided to look into how each group behaved with the same four initial (prior) beliefs as above.
