# Initial Exploration and Analysis of the AB Dataset

We began by looking at the dataset to see if the hour or day of the timestamp had an effect on the number of people who were converted.

Now we wanted to take a closer look at each of the groups and their conversion rates.

[Control Histograms](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/task_1/03-Control_Histograms.md)

After that, we decided we wanted to look further into the dataset and see what would happen if we started with different initial (prior) beliefs.

[Priors](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/task_1/04-All_Priors.md)

From the work above, we still had some questions about the behave of the data. We then decided to look into how each group behaved with the same four initial (prior) beliefs.
