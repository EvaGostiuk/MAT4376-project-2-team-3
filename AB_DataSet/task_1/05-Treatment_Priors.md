# Looking into how an increase in treatment datapoints causes four different priors all to converge to the same median

Then, we wanted to take a look just at the treatment group. 

First, we took 12 subsets of 100 random datapoints and looked into their convergence with the same four initial priors:

For the first prior, we got the following results:

![priors1 - treatment](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior1_treatment.png?raw=true)



For the second prior, we got the following results:

![priors2 - treatment](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior2_treatment.png?raw=true)



For the third prior, we got the following results:

![priors3 - treatment](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior3_treatment.png?raw=true)



For the fourth prior, we got the following results:

![priors4 - treatment](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior4_treatment.png?raw=true)
