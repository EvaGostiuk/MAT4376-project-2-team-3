# Looking into how an increase in datapoints causes four different priors all to converge to the same median

Next, we decided we wanted to switch gears and look into how different priors will converge based on the number of datapoints pulled. 

First, we took 12 subsets of 100 random datapoints, of either group, and looked into their convergence with the following four initial priors:

![priors](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/priors.png?raw=true)

For the first prior, we got the following results:

![priors1 - all](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior1_all.png?raw=true)



For the second prior, we got the following results:

![priors2 - all](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior2_all.png?raw=true)



For the third prior, we got the following results:

![priors3 - all](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior3_all.png?raw=true)



For the fourth prior, we got the following results:

![priors4 - all](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior4_all.png?raw=true)
