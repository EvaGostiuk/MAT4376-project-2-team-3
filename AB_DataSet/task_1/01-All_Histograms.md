There is an overall uniform distrubtion for both graphs. 
Graph 1 shows the time both the control and treatment groups accessed the website and were converted.
Graph 2 shows the days both the control and treatment groups accessed the website and were converted, with the lowest values on the first and end date. 

Next we will look into each group on its own.
