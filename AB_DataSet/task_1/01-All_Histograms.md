# A First Look at the Data

First, we wanted to look into how many users were converted per hour of the day, regardless of what day it was.

Then, we wanted to look into how many users were converted per day throughout the reporting period.

There is an overall uniform distribution for both graphs. The first graph shows the time both the control and treatment groups accessed the website and were converted. The second graph shows the days both the control and treatment groups accessed the website and were converted, with the lowest values on the first and end date. 

Next, we will look into each group on its own and look at the number of converted users.
