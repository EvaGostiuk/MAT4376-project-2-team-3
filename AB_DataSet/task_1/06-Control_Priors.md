# Looking into how an increase in control datapoints causes four different priors all to converge to the same median

Then, we wanted to take a look just at the control group. 

First, we took 12 subsets of 100 random datapoints and looked into their convergence with the same initial priors.

For the first prior, we got the following results:

![priors1 - control](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior1_control.png?raw=true)



For the second prior, we got the following results:

![priors2 - control](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior2_control.png?raw=true)



For the third prior, we got the following results:

![priors3 - control](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior3_control.png?raw=true)



For the fourth prior, we got the following results:

![priors4 - control](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/images/prior4_control.png?raw=true)
