# Performing Inference and Finding Posteriors Probabilities on the AB Dataset

Our next task was to perform inference on the dataset by pulling subsets of 100 random datapoints and determining if/when their posterior probability converges and the number of datapoints no longer matters (in terms of convergence). We used the BernBeta function provided on the course webpage, which can be found [here](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/BernBeta.R)

Using the BernBeta function provided on the course webpage, we decided to use the function on the two groups separately.
