# Performing Inference and Finding Posteriors Probabilities on the AB Dataset

Our next task was to perform inference on the dataset by pulling subsets of 100 random data points and determining if/when their posterior probability converges and the number of data points no longer matters (in terms of convergence). We used the BernBeta function provided on the course webpage, which can be found [here](https://github.com/EvaGostiuk/MAT4376-project-2-team-3/blob/master/AB_DataSet/BernBeta.R).

Using the BernBeta function, we decided to look into the two groups separately. *(We recommend looking at the treatment group first)*
