# Using rbinom to Simulate a Bayesian AB Test for the AB Dataset

**maybe split up into three separate graphs??**

Lastly, we again want to follow the code from Example 12 provided on the course webpage but will instead use rbetabinom to collect the random samples in the simulation.

Now, we want to switch gears a little bit and focus on performing inference on the AB dataset and determining whether or not the dataset converges in its posterior probability.
